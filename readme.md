# **Cygnus**

Cygnus is a bird watching log for bird-watching enthusiasts! You can make a log of your sightings and add birds that you have seen on that sighting! Will help bird watchers keep track of their favorite hot-spots and nature walks for their favorite hobby!

## Why I chose Cygnus.

I wanted to create an app that I know several people will use. In this way I could get real-world feed back on features that need to be improved and added! In addition, it would teach me how to consume APIs while learning a bit about birds! 

## Instructions

1. Sign-up for an account!

2. Currently, the birds in the database must be added by each user. Once added, they can access them via the sightings tab.
>*Note: Currently all birds are limited to North America. In time there will be a search function that will make a 3rd party api call for the birds*

3.  Once in the sightings tab, you can create a log with a location, date and a short description of the sighting. You may add, edit or delete this log entry.

4. Once inside a sighting, you can add a bird, and the amount of that bird you have seen, to that sighting with the menu at the top of sightings.

2. IMplement 3rd part apis for images.

3. Search bar instead of dropdown menu

4. Ability to upload your own photos per sighting (aside from default image)

5. Global count of birds

6. Counts of bird sightings per user

7. geo-location data if possible
